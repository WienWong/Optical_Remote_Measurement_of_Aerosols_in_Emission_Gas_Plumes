# Optical_Remote_Measurement_of_Aerosols_in_Emission_Gas_Plumes
Temporal and spatial data analysis from several days of optical remote sensing measurements in Beijing and Tianjing, China. Since the data were collected from different spectrometers (using the DOAS, the SOF and the 'Flame') , the wind meter and the GPS tracker, data cleaning and merging were applied heavily. In order to remove spikes and outliers, signal filtering is quite necessary.

In order to separate and recognize various trace gas species (SO2, NO2, HCHO, Alkane, NH3 and Alkene), the principal component analysis (PCA) has been preliminary explored and performed.

Software used are R (in RStudio platform) and Octave (a little different from Matlab). Operating system is Ubuntu 14.10 (64-bit).
